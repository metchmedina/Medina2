<p class="b2">My elementary experience is full of fun and excitement.  It is hard and full of adventure, too.Waking up early is not easy.  This part of being a student is what I hated most during the first part of my studies. While I was at lower grade I do not eat on my own until I reached Grade IV. But in my elementary level, I learned many things from my subjects and from my encounters with bestfriends.  It is fun and exciting and meeting new friends.We share jokes and laughter.But of course, I do my assignment on my own.  During break time we run after each other, teasing one another.  These made me happier while in school.</p>
