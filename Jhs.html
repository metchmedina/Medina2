<p class="c2">Junior High was a very good experience for me, it was filled with excitement. I would always walk down the hallway knowing everyone. High school grows you into the person you are. I have great memories, good and bad, some learning experiences and some that Iâ€™ll take with me the rest of my life. My high school experience has influenced my development as a person inside and outside of the class by making me more independent, choosing friends wisely and teachers motivating me to attend college and accomplish goals I have set for myself.</p>
