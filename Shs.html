<p class="d2">As a Senior High School student, it was a great privilege and the best journey that I had experienced in my entire life so far.I had met many friends and teachers in this school. and also I learned a lot of lessons and things inside this school. when I enrolled here in this school, I never thought that I am lucky because I enhanced myself and showcased my talents and my ability to others. And also we became more knowledgeable and matured enough on everything. New Classmates, Schoolmates, Teachers, and friends.</p>
